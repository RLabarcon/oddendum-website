    <h1>We did it, everyone!</h1>
    <h4>November 3, 2015</h4>

    <p>Huzzah! It’s November <del>1st</del> <del>2nd</del> 3rd, 2015, the long-awaited date for our massive online fanbase.</p>
    <p>Yes. We’re running on only a single page of content right now, but please,<p>
    
    <h2>DON’T PANIC.</h2>

    <p>You will be happy to know that this is the least amazing this website will ever be. Ever. Think of it as a seed that hasn’t yet grown.</p>

    <div class="banner">

    </div>

    <p>With a little time and effort from the Oddendum team, this site will grow its various branches and leaves of category and content until it metamorphoses into a beautiful webmag. I will personally try to update the site once every couple of weeks, having added or refined some aspect of it, and all of us will be working to bring something fresh to the site daily. </p>

    <p> At this point, you may have a few questions. For example: </p>

    <i><p>What is Oddendum?</p></i>

    <p>We needed a place to put the ideas we had that didn't quite fit anywhere else--a nonstandard, cohesive platform for expression that could play host to an array of topics, perspectives, and voices while becoming better for the diversity. We also wanted a portfolio for our best work and a sandbox for improving the work that isn't quite there yet.</p>

    <p>So we built one.</p>

    <i><p>Why not just use social media?</p></i>

    <p>Sites like twitter and facebook are phenomenal tools for publicizing content, and while they are an accessible and ubiquitous medium for <b>sharing</b>, social media's not so great a platform for producing and hosting content. It lacks the creative range and control of an independent website--something vitally important to the folks here at Oddendum.</p>

    <p>After all, how can we express ourselves without a dynamic logo, animated interactivity, and full-page photos? The very thought is absurd and off-putting.</p>

    <i><p>Who's "we"?</p></i>

    <p>We have a special, alphabetized section for that!</p>

    <div class="profile-picture-slider">
      
      <div>

        <div class="profile taylors "></div>

      </div>

      <div>
      
        <div class="profile ravenstorms"> </div>

      </div>

      <div>
      
        <div class="profile jamess"></div>

      </div>

    </div>

    <i><p>Wow, you guys are radical. How can I make sure I don't miss a single juicy post from you distinctly agreeable chaps?</p></i>

    <p>We're going to put a newsletter system in place and set up shop in the social media channels. This isn't in place yet, but it will be within the first couple of updates.</p>

    <i><p>I have something you might think is awesome! How can I tell you this?</p></i>

    <p>At this point, you can use the tubes to get over to twitter, where you can tell me things through my handle @TheRavenstorm, and I'm sure that @TheJamesLy would gladly help as well. In the future, though, we'll be accepting submissions at contact@oddendum.com.</p>
