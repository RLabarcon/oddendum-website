          <p>It's a new year--a turning point, an agreed-upon moment of looking back on the past while reveling in the promise of the future.
          </br>
          <p>Here at Oddendum, we are always pushing the boundaries of what’s possible--always striving to bring you a higher standard of content than you might find elsewhere on the web. </p>
          </br>
          <p>This time around, our team of dedicated editors has conjured a retrospective on the past year...on the very first day of the year!</p>
          </br>
          <p>“How is this possible?” you may ask.</p>
          </br>
          <p>In layman's terms, our backroom boys have tapped into the very same font of magic that allowed multitudes of people to get 2016 cars back in 2015--technicality.</p>
          </br>
          <p>The Oddendum team takes pride in being ahead of the curve to the extent that it takes priority over having an entire year to look back on, so in a stroke of retrospective genius, we borrowed most of 2015 to look back on as well.</p>
          </br>
          <p>It's a year-in-review written in 2016. That's what matters. That's what gives us our edge.</p>
          </br>
          <p>“Are you making an excuse for releasing your content late?” you may ask.</p>
          </br>
          <p>Without further ado, this is...</p>

If there was a franchise to ruin, Konami would make it so. A putrefying heathen of a brilliant studio."</b></i></p>
