        <p>When I received an email from Spotify, I expected an update to one of the many playlists I follow, but instead I was greeted by the headline, “Twenty One Pilots wants to thank you”. Well, their vague hook worked and upon clicking the email, I found a link to Spotify-foundthemfirst.com; a site in which spotify shows the user“how many artists he/she streamed before they got big”. I apparently discovered 10 bands, including Twenty One Pilots, and was specifically told the date when I first streamed the band and that I’m “the first X% of all listeners.” Some of the pages for bands I’ve discovered feature videos of the bands thanking me for being a fan from the beginning - conspicuously, Twenty One Pilots was not one of these bands. At first glance the whole feature felt odd to me...</p>
 <p>Spotify is making it cool to have heard of bands before they were cool. In other words, Spotify is celebrating and even rewarding hipsterism.  Being a hipster is essentially an aggressive form of counter-culture, purposefully rejecting what is popular and adapting whatever is obscure. Spotify is patting users on the back for being obscure, which against the whole point of hipsterism. It seemed like Spotify could accidentally push away those that they are trying to thank, but I learned it’s not that simple.
The sensationalized version of being a hipster that one sees on social media (bringing records to a coffee shop to listen to, or wearing suspenders and bow ties to that same coffee shop) doesn't really exist, and in reality many people who are often labeled as hipsters just happen to like things that are a little bit out of the norm, such as obscure bands or fashion trends.</p>
<p>That's where Spotify’s celebration of hipsters starts to makes sense. People are not discovering new artists just to put a middle finger to the man; they just happen to enjoy those bands more than they enjoy bands on the radio. The Found Them First program is a smart PR move to give back to their customers who think that they are helping bands out by listening to them. The program is saying that Spotify users are helping bands and, by proxy, Spotify is helping bands. Early adopters are very important to a band’s success because word of mouth is the only way to garner an audience, but Spotify isn’t designed with this process in mind. In reality the only way Spotify helps artists on the platform is by paying them less than a cent per listen. Therefore, Spotify saying that I helped make Twenty One Pilots successful isn’t directly true; by listening to them I’ve put, at most, $2 dollars into their pockets.</p>
    <p>The “Found Them First” feature is Spotify’s public relations attempt at saying they help bands, which is a sentiment they desperately need after many recent critiques of their business model being unfair to artists.The artists themselves are especially plussed about the situation, with songs like “Dark Comedy Late Show” by Open Mike Eagle: “I finally gave in and became a Spotifier, giving myself a fraction of a penny playing Qualifiers” (Qualifiers being another one of his songs). Taylor Swift even famously pulled all of her music off of the service. The “Found Them First” website is a clever PR move to rid of the company’s recent stigma. At the same time the site make the users feel cool by telling them that their music tastes shaped which direction the music industry went.
